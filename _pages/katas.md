Code Katas are way for us to practice coding skills outside of the complexities of a real life environment. I often use Katas as a way to teach others and improve my own skills in things such as Test Driven Development (TDD), code structure and best practices. Katas can be done in your preferred language so there is no need to use the languages specified.

Below are some Katas I have used for teaching others or simply learning.
